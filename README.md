        <!-- 沟通态度 -->
        <h4>Communication attitude:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When receiving complaints, you must keep smiling and make eye contact, use empathetic sentences (such as "I'm very sorry for the inconvenience"), and avoid using commanding tone. When facing an agitated customer, first calm them down with empathetic sentences, then move on to the solution. Do not interrupt the customer or use statements to shirk responsibility.</li>
            <li>For customers with different cultural backgrounds (such as Muslims and Jews), they should respect their religious dietary taboos. Any related complaints should be checked unconditionally and the meals should be replaced.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- 非歧视服务原则 -->
        <h4>All staff must abide by the principle of non-discriminatory service:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All customers should be treated equally, and complaints should not be treated differently due to differences in consumption amount and cultural background.</li>
            <li>For different types of customers, such as new customers, regular customers and enterprise customers, customized solutions should be provided when dealing with complaints based on their consumption habits and demand characteristics (such as priority upgrade compensation scheme for regular customers, written rectification report for enterprise customers, etc.).</li>
            <li>Multicultural service training (such as Japanese etiquette and Islamic dietary taboos) is conducted every month, and new employees must pass the simulated assessment of disability services before they can work.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- 商业道德准则 -->
        <h4>Code of Business Ethics:</h4>

        <!-- 其他标准 -->

        <p>Ensure that the food provided meets safety and hygiene standards, and the menu should accurately label information (such as the source of ingredients, allergens, etc.).</p>
        
        <h4>Customer rights protection:</h4>
        <p>For reasonable refund or exchange requests from customers (such as dishes not matching the description, foreign objects, etc.), they should be verified and handled in a timely manner to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of consumers.</p>
        
        <!-- 特殊群体服务 -->
